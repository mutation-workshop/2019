# CALL FOR PAPERS

Mutation 2019: The 14th International Workshop on Mutation Analysis
April 22, 2019, Xian, China

https://mutation-workshop.github.io/2019

Co-located with ICST 2019
(12th Intl. Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation)


## About Mutation 2019

Mutation is acknowledged as an important way to assess the fault-finding
effectiveness of test sets. Mutation testing has mostly been applied at the
source code level, but more recently, related ideas have also been used to test
artefacts described in a considerable variety of notations and at different
levels of abstraction. Mutation ideas are used with requirements, formal
specifications, architectural design notations, informal descriptions (e.g. use
cases) and hardware. Mutation is now established as a major concept in software
and systems V&V and uses of mutation are increasing. The goal of the Mutation
workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss new
and emerging trends in mutation analysis. We invite submissions of both
full-length and short-length research papers as well as industry practice
papers.


## Topics of interest

- Mutation-based test adequacy criteria (theory or practical application).
- Mutation-based test data generation.
- Higher order mutation testing.
- Novel mutation testing paradigms and applications.
- Empirical studies of mutation testing.
- Formal theoretical analysis of mutation testing.
- Comparative studies (i.e., studies that compare mutation with other
  techniques).
- Mutation testing tools.
- Industrial experience with mutation testing.
- New mutation systems for programming languages and for higher-level
  representations.
- Increasing the efficiency of mutation. 
- Mutation for mobile, internet and cloud based systems. 
- Mutation for security and reliability.


## Submissions & Publication

Three types of papers can be submitted to the workshop:
- Full papers (10 pages): Research, case studies
- Short papers (6 pages): Research in progress, tools, experience reports,
  problem descriptions, new ideas
- Industrial papers (6 pages).

Each paper must conform to the two-column IEEE conference publication
[format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) and must be
submitted in PDF format via
[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mutation19).
Submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the
work and to their ability to generate discussions between the participants of
the workshop. Three reviewers will review each paper and all accepted papers
will be published as part of the ICST proceedings.

## Important Dates

- Submission of full papers: January 21, 2019
- Notification of acceptance: February 10, 2019
- Camera Ready: February 15, 2019
- Workshop date: April 22, 2019

## Special Issue on Mutation Analysis and its Industrial Applications

Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit an extended
version of their paper to a special issue on _Mutation Analysis and its
Industrial Applications_ published by the Journal of Software Testing,
Verification and Reliability (STVR). The extended papers will go
through the regular review process but will be assigned at least one
reviewer from the Mutation 2019 Program Committee.
