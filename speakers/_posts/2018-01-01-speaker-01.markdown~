topic: >
 Mutation: what have we done and what can we do next?
abstract: > 
 There has been a good deal of mutation over the years! First I shall
 briefly summarize a range of established uses of mutation and then
 proceed to the real meat of the talk: what can we do next? The world
 is changing and a new range of technologies are gaining traction,
 from GPU computing, Deep Learning and AI more generally, through
 robotics to quantum computing. So how can mutation concepts apply in
 such areas? As cybersecurity becomes increasingly worrisome for the
 digital world, what further traction can mutation gain?
 
 The talk should spark debate about the future role of mutation and
 provide encouragement for mutation researchers to reach out (and in
 some cases far out) to other research communities.
bio: >
 John Clark studied maths and then applied statistics at Oxford before
 joining the security division of the software and systems house
 Logica in 1987. In 1992 he took up the CSE Lecturer in Safety
 Critical Systems at the University of York, and was appointed
 Professor of Critical Systems in 2005.  He currently holds the Chair
 in Computer and Information Security at the University of Sheffield.
 His work has been cited over 6400 times, spanning many aspects of
 high integrity software. He was Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit
 Award Holder 2013-2017 and has received 11 best paper or similar
 awards since 2004. His mutation work has included the first Java
 mutation work, mutation on Statecharts, evolution on a nuclear power
 system, mutation of formal specifications and proofs, and the
 automation of test generation for mutant killing, particularly the
 use of meta-heuristic search based approaches. He is currently
 sponsored by Engineering and Physical Science Research Council
 (EPSRC) via the Programme Grant: Dynamic Adaptive Automated Software
 Engineering (DAASE - EP/J017515/1).
